Abstract: As now well established, the world population is aging rapidly and, according to recent studies, 
in 2010, an estimated 524 million people were aged 65 or older,  the 8\% of the world's population, and  by 2050, this number is expected  to nearly  triple to about 1.5 billion, representing 16 percent of the world's population.
For this reason, an emerging important issue is the definition  of a new generation of healthcare platforms capable of monitoring people's quality of life. With this in mind, in this work we propose a new methodology that allows to define and model a smart healthcare platforms that support the acquisition of healthy data during the life of a person. The methodology will support the entire definition process starting from the initial phase of gathering the requirements, both clinical, technological and user, up to the software modeling process and choice of the most suitable devices. In this work we will applied our proposal in a real scenario and we will provide a end-to-end session experiments.
